Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

Hint

    Check the data type of the inputs.
    Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
    Remember PEMDAS.
    Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
